This Project is designed for real-time pedestrian detection and data transmission to ThingSpeak. It utilizes the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks, the imutils library for image processing utilities, and the HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) feature extractor with a pre-trained SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier for pedestrian detection.
Overall Workflow:
-Initialize HOG descriptor and SVM detector: The project sets up the necessary tools for pedestrian detection, including a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
-Start recording: The record function begins capturing frames from the webcam.
-Detect pedestrians in each frame: For every frame captured, the detector function is called. This function processes the frame, applies the HOG descriptor and SVM classifier, and identifies potential pedestrian locations.
-Send data to ThingSpeak: The number of detected pedestrians in each frame is transmitted to ThingSpeak, a data platform for IoT devices, at regular intervals. This allows for real-time monitoring and analysis of pedestrian activity.
-Continuous operation: The process continues until the user manually stops the script, providing a constant stream of pedestrian detection data to ThingSpeak.
